Get to kissin' and touchin' a lil bit
Get to lickin' and fucking a lil bit


This is 50, comin' out your stereos
Hard to tell though, cause I switched the flow
Eyes a lil low, cause I twist the dro'
Pockets on swoll cause I move the O's
My neck, my wrist, my ears is froze
Come get ya bitch, she on me dawg
She musta heard about the dough
Now captain come on and save a hoe
I get it crunk in the club, I'm off the chain
Number one on the chart, all the time mayn
When the kid in the house, I turn it out
Keep the dance floor packed, thats without a doubt
And shorty shake that thang like a pro mayn
She back it up on me I'm like oh mayn
I get close enough to her so I know she can hear
System thumpin', party jumpin', I said loud and clear


All a nigga really need is a lil bit
Not a lot baby girl just a lil bit

New York City!
You are now rapping, with 50 Cent
You gotta love it, 
I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe


Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl


If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz, would you poof and disappear like 
Some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a ***** cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that




Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes, to make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile



Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, shawty
'Cause it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's yo birthday
We gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a ****
It's not your birthday!


You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Look mami I got the X if you into taking drugs 
I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love 
So come give me a hug if you into to getting rubbed 

When I pull out up front, you see the Benz on dubs
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty knives in the club
*****s heard I **** with Dre, now they want to show me love
When you sell like Eminem, and the hoes they want to **** 
But homie ain't nothing change hold down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the Cutt that ***** roll that weed up
If you watch how I move you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit wit a few shells but I don't walk wit a limp
In the hood then the ladies saying "50 you hot"
They like me, I want them to love me like they love 'Pac
But holla in New York them *****s'll tell ya I'm loco
And the plan is to put the rap game in a choke hold
I'm feelin' focused man, my money on my mind
I got a mill out the deal and I'm still on the grind
Now shawty said she feeling my style, she feeling my flow
Her girlfriend want to get bi and they ready to go

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things 
My crib, my cars, my pools, my jewels
Look, *****, I came up and I ain't changed

And you should love it, way more then you hate it
***** you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it
I'm that cat by the bar toasting to the good life
You that fagot *** ***** trying to pull me back right?
When my junk get to pumping in the club it's on
I wink my eye at ya *****, if she smiles she gone
If the roof on fire, let the ************ burn
If you talking bout money homie, I ain't concerned
I'm a tell you what Banks told me cause go 'head switch the style up
If the *****s hate then let 'em hate 
Watch the money pile up
Or we go upside there wit a bottle of bub
You know where we ****ing be



Don't try to act like you ain't know where we been either, *****
In the club all the time, *****, so it's a problem pop off, *****
G-Unit
Nights like this... I wish.
Rain drops would fall
5 heartbeats left
One last deep breath.

My ASCAP check got a nigga new haters.
The condos in Vegas - cause NY freezin',
My strap is the reason that you on the floor bleedin'.
I learned the Coke game Young and Watchin' 50!
And learned the dope game fast ask Bo-Diddly.
Automatic Mossberg in the all white fur

Shotgun pellets out of snow white spur. [shot] {DAMN!}


I been around the world and aiya-ya-ya!

Can you hear me baby?
If it look this good, I wonder how it taste? 
Baby if I touch your body, hear you scream my name 
Would you whisper to me it's yours? Girl you smell so gentle and pure
You control, My senses. Baby all, My senses

It's like everything's good, when I touch and you touch (one)
It smells like heaven, way better than a tulip (two)
Your love let me taste it, come here let me taste it (three)
Times of the essence baby don't you waste it
I'll tell you what I'm thinking, you'll listen to my thoughts (four)
So you can see my vision, then you'll never get lost (five)
If you follow my lead, girl I'll be what you need
I put my trust in you, now put your trust in me (senses)


If it look this good, I wonder how it taste? 
Baby if I touch your body, hear you scream my name 
Would you whisper to me it's yours? Girl you smell so gentle and pure
You conrtol, My senses. Baby all, My senses


I'll be a true friend, someone to believe in
I'll give you freedom, unconditional meaning
If tonight's her night? It's her night
Just get back to me tomorrow, aight?
I'm not into cuffin', I'm not into frontin'
I'm into gettin' paper, blowin' paper, I be stuntin'
See to me it's nothin', let's get into somethin'
Should I come pick you up? I'll meet you at the tele girlfriend


Would you whisper to me It's yours? Girl you smell so gentle and pure
You conrtol, My senses.

Baby if I touch your body, hear you scream my name 
Would you whisper to me It's yours? Girl you smell so gentle and pure

Yo Black is flashy like Alpo gun happy like Pappy
Sneaky muthafucka remind me of nigga that crack me
He aint the type you shoot dice with and win dog
Unless you want to get your ass layed out in gilmore
Yes we soldiers, remind me Troy and E-Bags
When they came through they hollored like 'What up Conrad?'
Grimey niggaz they loved to get gully
Summertime still had on black gloves and scullies
The Lex 450 pulled up that's Cornbread
Them niggaz from Philly would of called him an old head
But he an OG remind me of Chaz and Bump real low key
Sounded like he didn't know nothing about drama
For this money shit many men do trauma
Switchy walked in son, this bitch had the baddest ass
The bulletproof glass was rolled down on the S-Class
Heard in DC he kept mad blocks in order
Picture this a young nigga gettin it like Rich Porter
Sonny came in for half a pit
He got knocked, he on lock still controllin' his block from constop
Pop pulled up in the CL5 his project changed
His man just got fucking murked by Salene
Heard he got it in the range nigga Bean popped one in his brain
Over some-thing took his watch and his chain 
Country boys off the hook down there and Richmond main.
In the black 740 I sat, hat turned back
Bow down baby nelly singing my wrist blinging What!
I'm waiting on this nigga Wise we lost for two pies
Son he smokin that shit I can see it in his eyes
Coming up wise emotions closed 
Most buying round looking for wisemen toast
Benny hopped out the Esculade with a few thourough men from B-More
They sellin heroin in Maryland reverse back to Diesel
Killed like 4 fiends his popularity grew that only meant more cream
First it was him and his brother now he got a team
Went from 5 and a half grams to living the dream
City pulled up Goddamn you know his format
Bentley is all marble in the door and floor match
Got the gats out the stash box popped 2 glocks
Peace "All Eyez on Me" 2Pac
Everybody know he a boss he gotta floss
He on the same bullshit that sent Gotti up north
That's Dime in the blue ts stunting like he Nicky Barnes
He broke but he talk like he a Don
Homes hoppin out the Jag that's Max haitian cat
Kill a nigga quick remind me of Haitian Jack
I peep his style son I know his stelo, He on the d-low
He smile at niggaz mumbling fuck you in Creole
Heard war stories bout how he maneuver with the Ruger
Hold the iron horizontally and send shots through ya
Few niggaz tried to murk him, most them got fount
Some turnt away try to run they in wheelchairs now
Banks hopped out bulletproof this, bulletproof that
Bulletproof snorkel, bulletproof hat
Got out a Black hummer he blew 90 on that
Poppin mad shit like he gonna bulletproof that lets go
I guess this is 6 out of 6 muthafuckers


Tell me how do you want it, the knife or the razor
You running, I'm coming to get you boy
You can hide if you want but nothing can save ya
Times running out, I'ma get ya boy


I threw a b-boy style, bullet wound in my smile
That beef I cook it, niggas I gets down
Call it what you want, the clip, the ladder, banana
I bet when I squeeze it, niggas scatter
The hoes, that's a whole different story
Find out the baby ain't mine, right there on Maury
Me I make the whip fishtail, trunk full of fishscale
Raw market itself, sucka the shit sell
That's 36 o's of love, give me kiss, give me love
Get to talking in codes, the phones bugged
This Ferrari I get to the green, half man, hald machine
(Tu, tu, tu) I'm on ya head with the beam
So focused ferocious, I shoot ya pretty ass out them Gucci loafers
You're fucking with the wrong one
The strong one that God gave the gift
Stop the hater shit, you wanna make it
Why would you be mad I dun made it bitch


Tell me how do you want it, the knife or the razor
You running, I'm coming to get you boy
You can hide if you want but nothing can save ya
Times running out, I'ma get ya boy

Get get gully, g-g-get gully
Get get gully, g-g-get gully
We get gully and we get money
Them schemin' ass chicks can't get shit from me


Rain drops from heaven ? cryin'
It's raining outside, envision my gun firin'
Red and white flashes, the police coming
nigga you ain't hittin' none, why the fuck are you running
I make your momma wish your ass was a stillborn
When that eagle get to chirping on the front lawn
Where's teh love, I don't know but here's the snub
Sucker barrel swallow the slug, die like a thug
You know it's really not worth it
To fuck with me, you'd rather tongue kiss the serpent
Don't cry we all die
It's just a matter of time
nigga one shot from the nine will shatter your spine
Uh, the last of my breed, criminal tendancies inside of an emcee
fuck around I will line you
Run from me, I will find you
Forgot I'm nice, I will remind you




One, two, fifty coming for you
Three, four, better lock ya door
Five, six, grab ya crucifix
Seven, eight, don't stay up late
The monsters back
Yeah, I need a target
So I can smash their head
I'm nice!
(Like the fire needs the air)
(I won't burn unless your there)

Yea, I need you, I need you to hate
So I can use you for your energy
You know, it's real shit, feel this!


America's got a thing for this gangsta's shit, they love me
Black Chucks, black skullies, leather Pelle-Pelle
I take spit's over raymo shit, I'ma fan
Got that silver duck tape on my Trey Eight handle
The women on my life bring confusion shit
SO like Nino from New Jack, I'll have to cancel that bitch
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggaz around me so cold, man my heart dun froze up
I build an empire on the low the narc's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that coco leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the door
O after O, you know, homey I'm just triple beam, dreamin
Niggaz be schemin, I'm fiendin to live a good life
The fiends just fiendin
Conceal my weapon nice and easy so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me


I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (hustle)
Nigga you get in my way when while I'm tryin to get mine
And I'll buck you (buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga fuck you (fuck you)
I want to find the thing thats in my life
So I hustle (hustle)


Yea, I don't know shit about gymnastics I summersault bricks
Black talents start flyin, when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggaz can't fuck with me
Man my cold days, they called me chef boy are 50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in their weed shit
Send me them seeds I'll grow 'em what they need
Them ain't chia pet plants in the crib thats chronic
And I'm sellin them 500 a pop god damn it
I sold everythin I'ma hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes put in water and tell you its wine
If you analyze me, what you'll find is the DNA of a crook

What goes in my mind, it's contagious
Hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If the rap was the block or spider, I'll be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me where ever that dope be, gettin money man




Its a hustler's ambition, close your eyes listen, see my vision
Mossberg pumpin, shotgun dumpin and drama means nothin
It's part of the game, catch me in the coupe switchin lanes
In the jewels with your chains
I upgrade from 30 BS to clean VS
Rocks that I copped procedes from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Played it perf and get nauseous, watchin the spinner spin
I make plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite yo ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Crystal in the blender and make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he don't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey they can't stop me
Racist, pointin at me look at the nigga ratchi
Hello!

And you friends they see it to screaming we know what your up to do girl
I'm after my cheddar


I gave you your style Gucci this Fendi that
Burberry bag shoes and the hat to match
I like the way it look but bitch I aint buying that
I hate to be the bearer of bad news but no more Prada shoes
When I just wanna chill you wanna go out
See me parle with some other chick you wanna show out
You say I'm wrong when I dog yo ass like I should
now you reminisce about all the time I treated you good




when you think about me grinding my fans
You even got more watch on but it's to much time on your hands
They say behind every good man is a woman
So tash pull up stash the cannon linen
I'll never be your chofuer to the mall
You'll learn to appreciate cd's and posters on the wall
fatal attractions is mad real
Last bitch I deaded got mad and swallowed 50 Advil's



They say money make the world go round
Material things make a hoe go down
I see you in your Prada Gucci and BCBG
Bitch I'm gettin' rich but I don't trick on GP
That's 5 dollar dresses and 10 dollar skirts
Bitch play the strip and put in work
Birds wanna have my baby since I signed my contract
So I got to double up in case the condom snap


Look don't ask me for shit man
I aint got nothing for you man what?
Bitch what the fuck you mean I can't sing bitch
Bitch I'm Luther Vandross in the shower
Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, we out though, we out though
Cocaine, heroin, we 'bout dough, we 'bout dough
Cops coming, we runnin', we out yo, we out yo
Fuck you thought we was trickin', get out ho, get out ho


I smile when that money come, stunt when that money come
Niggas front when that money come, and I'ma have to handle them
Man I don't trust none of them, why they bringin' and come with them,
Why they come in a cop, fuck around and get shot
I'm on that cold blood nigga shit I will pull a trigger 'cause
You'd better do your homework you'll find out who you fucking with
'Cause I ain't full of sucker shit, I'm joking no Chris Tucker shit
I ain't even smilin', I'ma 'bout to start wylin'
I got bricks of that Peruvian
A though face medicine, sniff that in doughs, that's a dope fiends regimen
Range Rover, game over, I'm getting my lean on

Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, we out though, we out though
Cocaine, heroin, we 'bout dough, we 'bout dough
Cops coming, we runnin', we out yo, we out yo
Fuck you thought we was trickin', get out ho, get out ho

Niggas ain't playin' yo, we still on that gangsta shit
That block mine, find out when my Glock 9, pop
I'm surrounded by shooters, so I ain't got to shoot it
You niggas on computers better sit there and compute it
Dodge what I just said, or get shot and left for dead
You think you don't give a fuck nigga, I don't give a fuck
I pistol whip your ass down, watch your homies pick you up
I got 2 million cash, that's my brown bag money
Think maybe that's why niggas'll just fire mags for me
It's the telephone game, I done heard through the grape vine
Niggas talk crazy until the holows start flying


Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall, we out though, we out though
Cocaine, heroin, we 'bout dough, we 'bout dough
Cops coming, we runnin', we out yo, we out yo
Fuck you thought we was trickin', get out ho, get out ho

Yea, G-G-G-G-G-UNIT! (G-UNIT!)
Ha ha...


It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't BACK DOWN
Everywhere I go both coasts wit toast
Eastside, Westside, I hold that MACK DOWN
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold SHAQ DOWN
Next time you in the hood and see an OG ITS OG DUMB MOTHERFUCKING CRACKER
You ask about me, the young boy don't BACK DOWN

Any living thing that cannot co-exist with the kid
Must decease existing, little nigga, now listen
Yo mami, yo papi, that bitch you chasing
Ya little dirty ass kids, I'll fucking erase them
Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard
Knowing that, you get knocked, you get fucked in the yard
Youza poptart sweetheart, you soft in the middle
I eatcha for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
and your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge
You can buy cars but you can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful cause to me you're a mystery
I know niggas from ya hood, you have no history
Never poked nothing, never popped nothing, nigga stop fronting
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot
Ha, ha pussy...



"This rap shit is all fucked up now! What are we gonna do now?
How we gonna eat man? 50 back around"
That's Ja's little punk ass thinkin out loud
Southside, Tah died, that's just how I get down
I'm back in the game shawty, to +Rule+ and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggas, they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggas in the background
You never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah & Crack Child.
Them niggas they just SUCK, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say "they like them in the hood"
I'm back better than ever, on top of my game
Even them country boys saying "50 we feeling you mayn"
Now you stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own...BAD GUY (BAD GUY)



I ain't telling anyone you pussy
I ain't telling anyone you gettin extorted
It ain't over.... (G-UNIT)
I've been patently waiting to BLOW
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the "50 Cent Show"
This is my life, my pain, my night, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep
I'm a nightmare huuhhhh
You hired cops to hold you down cause you fear for your life
You heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't going no where, I done told you nigga
I'm a G-Unit motherfucking soldier nigga (They not gonna like you)
I know, I know...ha, ha (G-UNIT)
Yo, yo we can't stay alive forever
So if shit hit the fan then we might as well die together
I'm high as ever, more holes and more cheddar
G-Unit move around wit them pounds and berreta's
Yea faggot, if I want it I'm gon' have it
Regardless if it's handed to me or I gotta grab it
Don't make a ass outta yaself tryin to stop me
I'm cocky, raps rocky, nigga you sloppy
You know that I'm, 8 levels above you nigga
I'll club you nigga, I never heard of you nigga, ugly nigga
I'm the wrong one to provoke
You rattin on niggas is only gon' leave you smoke
So the only thing left now is tools for these cowrads
I got no friends, fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit 'till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars, they lay around flowers

I got a intergangstress who argue and steams wit reefer
And who flip when I call a bitch like she Queen Latifah
Not all the vehicle's is long enough to stash the streetsweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
We slidin through the ruckus, wit prada on the chuckus
Soon as spring break ho's home from college wanna fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckas
I'll sick rottweiler's on you fuckas, cops followin to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lotta zeros
When it comes to paper I blow a soul outta aero
I'ma break before I lay floor berry
Besides, every rapper ain't a star, nigga plad ain't bulbary
You can't tame Lloyd, smokin by the big screen
You changin the channel looks like I'm playin the game boy
I know to watch botherin ya vision
You reach and I'll put a dot on ya head like its part of yo religion
Why party wit a pigeon?
I'm blowin a 10 cuz Bush handin flyers for a party in a prison
I'm in the gucci vest wit the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
And there aint problem gettin dressed cuz my closet got more aisles than pathmark
Run, move startin a wave
and leave wit 12 shells in ya mouth like a carton of eggs
I'm the young pimp pardon my age
I don't got long hair but if I did she be puttin my braids
Niggas find what club they at
take 'em wit us, and run a train on 'em like a subway mac
get advances from grey agra
see these record labels got most artists gettin fucked like the gay rappa'
i go the college on the tour
I'm goin down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
I keep ya ammo clean, text polished in the drawer
Camera's by the hamper that mine into the floor
by now, you probably heard of me
fresh outta surgery, flashy as a fuck, you gon' have to murder me
Burglary, I'm leavin wit cha nike's bergendy, White T, bergendy
you match now, back down
niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
catch me on the boat wit weed smoke and fishin' gear
heavy when I toke, C notes from different years
Besly in the robe, re-motes for liftin chairs
You ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya
I send cars to crib like I'm a cab dispatcha
you better off wit ya stupid guys, lookin for a coupe to drive
you ain't gettin nuttin but ya french fries supersized
it's a damn shame y'all still local
I'm in a million dollar studio layin my vocals

Niggas trynna front on my swag, knock it off
Put the strap to the back of your knot and knock it off
Homicide they have to come through, block it off
That's what they do after that choppa get to choppin' off (It ain't easy bein' me)
They say a nigga off, and nigga nigga off
I'm on the runway one way takin' off

Diamond cloth, plush lawn, it's floss at all costs

Diamond stud show off, nigga's swag is so off
They stunt till I go off, the 6 hour blow off
My wahi mahi-mahi teriyaki I'm so cocky
Who the fuck out here to stop me, nigga haters sit and watch me
And it seem like it is but it's not the same man niggas ain't got what I got my man
Got a flow so pure like brick cocaine nigga bitch wanna be my secret man
Freaky thing you eat that thing, every now and then I beat that man
She tell a nigga not to say a thing, but I can't keep a secret man (It ain't easy bein' me)
Nigga no wait, no time box, no funeral

It’s click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk

Think I got him, 10 shots, follow the trail of the blood drops
Fuck the police, better talk to a lawyer
Nigga you bleeding bad, yeah, you bleeding bad
Your Rolex soaked, like the cortex in your neck
It’s gonna get dark
Where’s the cops when you fucking need them?
That blood feeling your lungs boy I see you weezing
The harder you tryna run you mug leaking
You could have found something better to do this weekend

Guns ammo, knife Rambo,
Nightmare, wake up on right there
You hellbound, hell yea

Eating all that pussy guess cat got your tongue
Open up your mouth when …

This is a sad scene, at least you die happy
Next lick eater looking like you was smiling at me

Who I’m abouts, with my ops, they wanna dump him

It’s click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
It’s click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk X 2

Nigga you play around, I lay you down
That's how it's goin' down

My headachin', and I need my medicaaaaaaation
Niggaz be hatin', they don't know what they faaaaaacin'
Nigga you play around, I lay you down

Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
That's how we get down
22's on the jeep
Somthin' deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
That's how we get down


Wise men listen and laugh while fools talk
Stick up kids don't live long in New York
Fuck around and catch the wrong jukes on the street
Get caught slippin', then get hit wit' like three
In every hood in the US, I'm that nigga they feelin'
Rap full of good guys, 50 Cent is the villan
I play the bar with 8 bottles all night gettin' right
Teachin' the hoodrats what Cristal taste like
I put 60 on wrist, 12 on my fist, 100 on my neck
We in the hood nigga schemin', what you expect?
My S on 22's leave ya hos confuuuuuused
On the track ready to choose, like "Daddy we want you"
My love live ain't change, the shorties still hug me
Bullet wound in my face, and bitches still love me
Now Nelly told you how them country boys talk
I came to teach you how we put it down in New York
That's how we get down


Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
That's how we get down
22's on the jeep
Somthin' deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
That's how we get down


In the city, a young buck'll tell you how the mac spit
O.G. give 'em the word, you gonna get yo' ass hit
I don't know why niggaz like to talk bad about me
I'm the richest nigga they know without a G.E.D.
Man it could be the money, it could be the ice
It could be they'd like to be me and can't live my life
You should here they be sayin' man "50 be flippin'"
"Shot my man over 7 grams, that nigga be trippin'"
I know death is promised, I don't fear gettin' murked
It's when a nigga half-way killa ya homie, it hurts
Now we can hit the club and get it crunked
Or you could start some shit, and I could hit you with
the pump, you can have it how you want
But I know you like my style (Uh-Huh)
Ya like how I break it down, wanna get rich?
I'll show you how, take this pack, pump these pieces
That's how we get down


Better watch how you talk
Better watch where you walk
On the streets of New York
That's how we get down
22's on the jeep
Somthin' deep in the seat
When we creep wit the heat
That's how we get down

I'm on that bullshit
I'm, I'm, back on that bullshit
I'm on that bullshit
I'm, I'm, back on that bullshit

Startin to feel like there's nothin left to talk about but the, money, money
Bill collectors keep comin when a nigga fucked up, to get money, money
Nigga I don't give a fuck 'bout these hoes
I'm focused on the money, MONEY (money) MONEY!
Look, I don't wan' talk 'bout these hoes
Let's talk about money, MONEY (money) MONEY!


In high school I had coke and dope money
I blew, now I'm sittin on Bugatti boat money
I'm eatin, I get money, nigga I shit money
It smell like Benjamins, it boosts my adrenaline
Go 'head fuck around, I got marksmen hit money
You fuckin with that EBT welfare WIC money
Who wan' catch a fade? Fuck that! Catch a blade
Catch a case, bail bond, I'm out the next day
Got that gold (Hammer), gold (2 Legit) proper money
Talkin 'bout private jet, heliport chopper money
And a nigga still ridin with the chopper on me
I don't trick, e'ry now and then I toss her money
Fuck, nut, get up, that's abortion money
I'll kill if I have to, don't force me homie
I get that schoolyard duct tape extortion money
I hate when niggaz act like bitches cause it costs me money
What the fuck!




I'm in London blowin pounds, Japan blowin yen
It's the methodical diabolical nigga with a grin
My stash look like a rainbow, my money is gay
Nowadays I'm just happy things are goin my way
I'm straight, some say I got more than I need
Mucho dinero out in México, they growin my weed
It's amazing, I made it here on my own
I got a frog, a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to count, the amount I spent
Wine cellar full of shit, we could all get bent
I got it made, I got Brinks truck money
Euros, grams, you wan' borrow some from me?
My bank statements have you niggaz like "Damn!"
Bitch I got more (francs) than a hot dog man
Get married, pay for one bitch, I'll buy her bar food
Kids don't try this shit at home, you can't do the shit I do
Whassup?
I'm in the club tryna get me some hoes
Or, I'm on the grind tryna get me some dough
I hustle hard, niggas already know
I do what I gotta do and proceed to keep it moving
Holla at me if you're ready to roll
I aint gotta tell you I want you, you already know
I keep my eye on you, while you out on the floor
Girl, you turn me on, watching you move to the music

I'mma flash the cash you know I'ma get it
You wanna give me the ass, you know I'm with it
The flows so sick the way I spit it
The say its prolific, lets be specific
Can I kick it, yes I can
You rocking with fifty fifty and Timbaland
We are not the same nigga now understand
I do what I want boy, you do what you can
Everythings going according to plan, no more
Cause signing them all hand to hand
My new hustle bring millions in
Damn what a difference between now and then
ha ha, you see it, you really believe it
When I done came up, and I aint changed up
I'm in the house with the toaster yo
Things are going how they supposed to go



This is what you been missing
I'm back in position, I listen
Theres nobody better, you know I go hard for the cheddar
The drama I bring it, way, way better than I sing it
Gotta put in work to ring the bells, my name ringing
It's murder on the dancefloor when my songs on
My competition just sit on the type of shit I'm on
We keep it going, til it, til it, til it break of dawn
I aint the one that you should be fronting or faking on
Stunt if you want, my niggas will have your Jacob on
I'm so ghetto, they say I'm so gutta
I don't dance, I be in the cut like "what up"
You know my style, know me, everywhere I go
I aint gotta say a word man, they already know
I'm a no-nonsense nigga that flow
Annoying conversation if it aint about dough
But if you tryna get it, I'm with it
I'm all in? for sho.

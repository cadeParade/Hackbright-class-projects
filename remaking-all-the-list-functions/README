List Operations
===============

First, work through the following resources on lists:
    * http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex32.html
    * http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex33.html
    * http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex34.html
    * http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex38.html
    * http://www.learnpython.org/page/Lists
    * http://docs.python.org/tutorial/introduction.html#lists
    * http://docs.python.org/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists
        --> stop reading before section 5.1.1

In this directory there are two files, list_operations.py and
test_list_operations.py. Try running "python test_list_operations.py" at the CLI
prompt. You should see a lot of console output that ends with the following text:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 25 tests in 0.007s

FAILED (failures=25)

The test_list_operations.py file contains tests for the functions defined in
list_operations.py. All the tests are failing because none of the functions are
implemented correctly. Your job is to write correct implementations for all the
functions in list_operations.py.

To check your work, you can run the test_list_operations.py file at any time to
get information on the currently failing tests. The failures will be listed in
alphabetical order by function name. When all the tests pass, you will see only
the following output:

.........................
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 25 tests in 0.002s

OK
